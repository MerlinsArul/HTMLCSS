                <p>Our University aims to become a model institution for higher learning thus creating high quality
                    intellectuals through carefully designed academic programmes.

                    infrastructure.
                    The contents of the courseware for the various programmes, address key issues of national importance
                    and all the programmes have an element of ‘value’ education embedded in them.
                    The programmes also take into account the changing needs of the industries, aimed to produce
                    graduates who form an integral part of a globally competitive workforce.
                    With the right mix of conventional teaching-learning mechanisms along with adequate support from
                    various ICT resources, the programmes offered at our University ensure success,
                    making our University a truly integrated University engaged in teaching, training, research and
                    consultancy. Our University also earnestly endeavours to be a part of the societal development
                    involved in various social and community development initiatives.</p>
