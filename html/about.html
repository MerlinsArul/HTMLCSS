                    <h1>We are world's largest university</h1>
                    <p> Humanity has always turned to excellence as a flower turns towards the sun. Quality thus perceived, is an abiding interest in, and a desire to develop, whatever is regarded as excellent in  Engineering, Technology, and Humanities. 
                        The need to educate and train young men and women, to hone them into professionally competent, rounded personalities has been our burning passion. It was Richard Mulcaster of Elizabethan England who declared: “It is not a mind, not a body that we have to cultivate, but a man, and we cannot divide him”.
                        Our University is committed to excellence with a holistic approach and has consistently maintained the highest standards in "a man-making education" in the immortal words of Swami Vivekananda, which can only be ensured by quality teaching of the finest calibre. 
                        We here in Our University lieve in Tagorean concept of "The Home and the World", keeping in mind, the vital importance of empowering women, by giving them their rightful place in national development.
